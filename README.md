## Responsive MERN E-commerce 

- This is my first MERN project with MongoDB, ExpressJS, React and NodeJS which I built from the scratch. 
- It's e-commerce page about shoes and clothes, where you can find information about products like price, size, color , you can search and filter products, add them to the cart and finally pay.
- In this project I have learned new backend technologies. 
- First one is ExpressJS which is build on top of NodeJS. I used it for creating backend server which contains my API and it's handling all my request for database. 
- Next new technologie for me is MongoDB. In Mongo Atlas I stored my whole database.
- With help of React implemented many generic reusible components which save me lot of lines of code and I can use them in future. Last big thing for me was implementing authentication with cookies.
